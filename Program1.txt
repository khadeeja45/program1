In this program I have created a function named SIGMA2 that takes one number as
 parameter to calculate the SIGMA2 for it and find the modulo for 109.
for that it goes through two nested loops the inner loops find the dividers of the number that the outer
loops iterates through and find the sum of squares of it and add it to the total.
